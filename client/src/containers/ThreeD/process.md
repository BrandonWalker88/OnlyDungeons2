## Three Js Plan

## What We Have Done:

*   Currently we have isolated the view of the scene to a div in the page
*   I have integrated the chat function from discord into the page itself and created an almost overhead display for it
*   Spotify needs to be integrated in the Threed page
*   Current DM information or PC information like a heads up display


## For better & more efficient rendering
*   rescaling current scene to half size and changing camera FOV? fulcrum?

## Travel/ Rendering
*   click events to travel between scenes? Done within the 3d environment? On click on doors/portals?

*   larger scene that contains multiple scenes for users to visit

*   collapisble HUD?


## Scenes to render
    *   dungeon
    *   sewer
    *   city
    *   forest
    *   mountain
    *   water?
